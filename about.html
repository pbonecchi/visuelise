  <p id="about-text">I am a dreamer. I am a photographer. I am a lover of life, love, and laughs.
    My focus on visual art has started at a young age with painting, later on in highschool I got my first DSLR camera and decided to play and experiment with light, shapes and textures, and above all, my friends as models, being inspired by young Romanian photographers. At the same time I was very interested in architecture and interior design, but I decided to follow a more media-related study in the end.</p>
